                My passion for event coordination began during my upbringing in
                the Eastern Cape of South Africa, where coming together in
                celebration was a central aspect of life. While pursuing new
                career opportunities, I relocated to Pretoria while maintaining
                my devotion to uplifting others.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-8">
                With a background in Human Resources and Commerce, I have
                cultivated a skill set that includes event planning,
                fundraising, and relationship building. My experience is broad,
                ranging from team-building activities to conferences and product
                launches.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-8">
                I excel at facilitating engaging and memorable events tailored
                to meet the unique needs of my clients.
